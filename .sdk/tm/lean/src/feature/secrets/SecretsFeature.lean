/- ProjectName SDK secrets feature: the API credential through a vendored
   @voxgig/sekreto provider chain, and the access-token exchange some APIs
   require on top of it. The lean port of tm/go/feature/secrets_feature.go -
   same contract, seam for seam, in this target's idiom.

   The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
   credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
   rather than the only one: when active, the credential is resolved through
   a sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
   provider - a `memory` store named `options` - so an explicit value always
   wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.

   WHERE THE SEAM IS. lean has ONE wire path: every entity operation crosses
   `SdkRuntime.runOp`, which builds the request and hands it to the client's
   fetcher chain (there is no raw direct()/graphql() client method - graphql
   is a point kind inside the pipeline). So this feature wraps the transport
   (`setFetcher`), exactly as go does, and resolves THERE: the wrapper is the
   sole writer of the authorization header for a chain-resolved credential
   (prepareAuth wrote it from `options.apikey`; the wrapper rewrites it from
   the resolved value with the same construction and the same `auth: null`
   suppression), and nothing is ever written back into the shared options
   map.

   MISS vs ERROR (sekreto's invariant): a provider MISS falls through - the
   op proceeds, unauthenticated if nothing else supplies a credential. A
   provider ERROR must FAIL the op: a broken vault never degrades into an
   unauthenticated request. The wrapper REFUSES TO SEND while the chain
   could not be built (a construction failure, or a malformed `providers`
   entry - never dropped, never shortened) and while the last resolution
   stands failed. Fail-closed at the one seam every request must pass, and
   WRAPPED BEFORE BUILT, so an init failure is closed rather than open.

   EXCHANGE: what the chain resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a
   short-lived ACCESS token from `exchange.path` (relative to options.base);
   the access token is what every request carries, and a response status in
   `exchange.statuses` (401) buys another and retries the same request once.
   Test mode buys nothing and answers with the deterministic
   `"test-" ++ exchange.response`.

   Concurrency is far simpler than go's: SIO is single-threaded, so the
   mutex, the shared in-flight resolution and the shared purchase collapse
   to plain IO.Refs. -/
