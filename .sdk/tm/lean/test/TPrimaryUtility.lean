/- ProjectName SDK primary utility corpus.

   Drives the SHARED language-neutral corpus (.sdk/test/test.json, section
   `primary`) — the same fixtures every other target executes — through this
   SDK's request-shaping utilities, so the cases cannot drift from the
   reference implementation. Each section is looked up by name and executed on
   the VENDORED @voxgig/omni engine through OmniResolver, exactly as the ts/js
   reference harness does.

   The ENGINE used to be in this file: `runset`, `deepEq`, `strCheck`,
   `matchDeep` and the pass/fail tally were this port's own copy of omni's
   algorithm. All of it is gone. What remains is what belongs to this SDK:
   which corpus section drives which utility, and how a corpus map becomes a
   live context. The file keeps its name (and the `primary` executable keeps
   its root), so no call site needed churn.

   Every section uses `runsetArgs`: a `ctx` entry arrives as `args[0]`, a MAP
   on this SDK's own heap, which the call site wires to the client
   options/config, runs the utility on, and which the resolver writes back
   after the call — which is what makes `match: {ctx: ...}` (retargeted onto
   `match: {args: {"0": ...}}` by the resolver, decision 4) read the POST-call
   state rather than a stale pre-call copy. This port needs no separate
   "typed context" step: `ctx` here IS a struct map, heap-backed and
   reference-stable, and the utilities mutate it in place. -/

/-- The entry's ctx map, wired to the client options/config so the utilities
    see them. `args[0]` IS the map omni handed over, so every write the
    utility makes to it is what `match.args.0` reads back.

    A non-map first argument cannot occur in the shipped corpus (every entry
    of every ctx section supplies one); a fresh map is used rather than
    failing, so a future fixture degrades to "asserts nothing about the ctx"
    instead of crashing the suite. -/

    -- Wiring it up needs ctxOf to prefer a fixture-supplied options/config,
    -- which changes every section here and could not be compiled or run when
    -- this change was made.
    --
    -- Left out rather than left in: an entry that runs with the wrong context
    -- is worse than one that does not run, and no coverage is lost — this
    -- section asserted nothing before either.
    --
    -- `primary.check` is likewise not driven: it is omni's OWN
    -- provider/DEF.client conformance group, not an SDK utility, and this
    -- suite passes its subjects explicitly rather than through a provider.
