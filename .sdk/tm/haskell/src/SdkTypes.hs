-- ProjectName SDK core types.
--
-- The SDK data model is the vendored voxgig struct `Value` type
-- (VoxgigStruct.hs): a JSON-shaped, reference-stable (IORef-backed) node used
-- for ctx data, specs, options, transport payloads and results — exactly as
-- the Python/Go SDKs pass map[string]any around.
--
-- Haskell is purely functional, but the operation pipeline is inherently a
-- shared-mutable state machine (feature hooks observe and mutate the context
-- across stages, transport wrappers re-bind the fetcher). So the pipeline
-- objects — context, control (as Value maps), the utility bundle, features and
-- entities — carry `IORef` cells and the whole pipeline runs in `IO`. The
-- feature/utility indirection the dynamic donors get from late binding is
-- reproduced with function-valued record fields (the utility "registrar"
-- pattern). spec/response/result/operation/point/control are struct `Value`
-- maps (already IORef-backed, reference-stable), so no separate record types.
--
-- An SDK error is a struct Value map tagged `__sdkerr__` (see SdkHelpers.mkErr)
-- so it can travel on `ctx.out` alongside pipeline products; the throwing path
-- raises it as `SdkException`.
