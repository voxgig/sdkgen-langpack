// The plugin DEFINITIONS the model selected for this feature, emitted by

// Upstream sekreto's contract since the registry was retired: a kind not
// passed in `plugins` is unknown to that Sekreto, so the model's choice of
// plugin groups IS the SDK's provider vocabulary.
//
// Config.dart imports this file (the generated #ImportFeatures block) and
// this file imports Config.dart back, which is a CYCLE - legal in Dart, and
// safe here because `FEATURE_PLUGINS` is a lazily-initialised top-level
// final that is first read in `init`, long after both libraries have
// loaded. Config emits the map unconditionally (empty when no group is
// active), so this import resolves in an SDK that carries the feature
// source without selecting a single plugin group.

// Secret access via a vendored @voxgig/sekreto provider chain, and the
// access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it. The dart port of
// tm/ts/src/feature/secrets/SecretsFeature.ts - same contract, dart idiom,
// and structurally the GO port rather than the ts one (see below).
//
// The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
// credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
// rather than the only one: when active, the apikey is resolved through a
// sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
// provider - a `memory` store named `options` - so an explicit value always
// wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.
// When the option is unset, the remaining providers (env, dotenv, a vault)
// are asked in order, and moving a credential from code to a vault becomes
// a configuration change.
//
// WHY THE TRANSPORT SEAM, AND NOT PreSpec. Dart's feature hooks ARE
// awaited (EntityBase's `fres = featureHook(ctx, 'PreSpec'); if (fres is
// Future) await fres;`), so a PreSpec resolve COULD fail an entity op the
// ts way. It would not be enough. `ProjectNameSDK.prepare()` runs no
// feature hooks at all, and `direct()` and `graphql()` reach the wire
// through it - so a feature that only resolved in PreSpec would leave both
// RAW paths uncredentialed and, worse, fail OPEN: a broken vault would
// still send the request, unauthenticated. Every wire path instead crosses
// one mutable field, `ctx.utility.fetcher`, so this feature wraps that -
// the same seam the netsim/retry/cache features wrap - and resolves there.
// One gate, every path, entity and raw alike.
//
// THE CREDENTIAL LIVES IN FEATURE STATE, never in the shared options map.
// The ts reference writes `client._options.apikey` so the synchronous
// prepareAuth picks it up; here the transport wrapper rewrites the header
// itself, from the same `options.auth.prefix` prepareAuth uses, so the two
// cannot drift and the options map stays exactly as makeOptions built it.
// (go documents the same choice for a stronger reason - a shared map read
// by concurrent goroutines. Dart is single-isolate, so this is not a data
// race here; it is what makes the raw paths work and keeps the seam the
// single writer of the credential.)
//
// MISS vs ERROR (sekreto's invariant): a provider MISS falls through - the
// op proceeds, unauthenticated if nothing else supplies a credential. A
// provider ERROR (unreachable vault, bad creds) must FAIL the op: a broken
// vault never degrades into an unauthenticated request. The wrapper
// refuses to call the inner transport at all in that case, and answers
// with the provider's OWN message.
//
// EXCHANGE: some APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What
// the chain resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived
// ACCESS token from a token endpoint (`exchange.path`, relative to
// options.base); the access token is what every request carries, and when
// a response status in `exchange.statuses` (401) says it is spent the
// wrapper buys another and retries the same request once. Concurrent
// purchases share the one in-flight exchange; test mode buys nothing and
// answers with a deterministic fake token.
